## 🔄 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

### 📂 Phases of SDLC

1. **Planning**

   - Requirements gathering from customers.
   - Prioritization by PMs and POs.

3. **Design**

   - SA prepares HLD & LLD.

4. **Implementation**

   - Developers code features.
   - DevOps engineers set up infrastructure.

5. **Testing & Integration**

   - QA tests functionality.
   - DevOps supports CI/CD pipelines.

6. **Maintenance**
   - SRE ensures uptime and resolves issues.

## 🧑‍💻 DevOps Engineer’s Role

### 🎯 Responsibilities

- Setup & manage infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, AWS resources).
- Create CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment.
- Assist developers with environments & tools.
- Ensure security integration within pipelines.
- Optimize workflows to reduce delivery time.

---

## 🛠 Project Management with Jira

### 📋 Why Jira?

- Tracks work progress across roles.
- Shows dependencies (e.g., DevOps blocked = Dev team blocked).

### 🗂 Key Jira Elements

1. **Epic**

   - A large feature or requirement (e.g., _15-min grocery delivery_).

2. **Stories**

   - Smaller tasks under an Epic.
   - Example for DevOps: _Set up Kubernetes cluster using Terraform_.

3. **Sprints**
   - 2–3 week cycles where Scrum Teams commit to completing stories.

### 📌 DevOps in Jira Workflow

- DevOps Engineers pick tasks assigned in Jira.
- Update task status:
  - `To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done`
- Add daily comments on progress to keep team & management informed.

## ⚡ DevOps Contribution to Efficiency

- Identify gaps in SDLC processes.
- Automate manual workflows.
- Integrate testing for faster releases.
- Support developers with environments.

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

✅ DevOps Engineers don’t get requirements directly from customers.  
✅ Their tasks come from Developers & SAs via Jira.  
✅ Collaboration across all roles is critical for success.  
✅ Jira is used daily for tracking and updating work.
