# 📘 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) for DevOps Engineers

---

## 🛠 What is SDLC?

- **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a standard process in the software industry.
- It ensures the **design, development, testing, and delivery of high-quality software products**.
- Followed by **startups, MNCs, and unicorns alike**.

### 🎯 Why is SDLC Important?

- To **deliver high-quality products** that meet customer expectations.
- Provides a structured approach: **Design → Develop → Test → Deploy**.

---

## 🔄 Phases of SDLC

### 1️⃣ Planning Phase

- **Goal**: Gather requirements and validate ideas.
- Conduct customer research and feedback analysis.
- Key stakeholders:
  - **Business Analyst (BA)**: Gathers requirements and prepares documentation.
  - **Product Owner (PO)**: Defines scope and priorities.

---

### 2️⃣ Defining & Requirements Specification

- Create **SRS (Software Requirement Specification)** document.
- Document:
  - Customer needs.
  - Market analysis insights.
  - Feature requirements.

---

### 3️⃣ Designing Phase

- **High-Level Design (HLD)**
  - Architectural overview.
  - Focus on scalability, availability, and system flow.
- **Low-Level Design (LLD)**
  - Technical implementation details (functions, modules, database schemas).

---

### 4️⃣ Building/Developing Phase

- Developers write the application code based on **HLD and LLD**.
- Use a **version control system (e.g., Git)** to store and manage source code.

---

### 5️⃣ Testing Phase

- **Quality Assurance (QA)** ensures the product works as expected.
- Tests for:
  - Functionality.
  - Performance.
  - Reliability.

---

### 6️⃣ Deployment Phase

- Application is deployed to the **production environment**.
- Customers start using the live system.

---

### 🔁 Iterative Process

- SDLC is **cyclical**.
- Each new feature (e.g., _adding a kids’ section in an e-commerce app_) follows the **same stages**.

---

## 🚀 DevOps Engineer’s Role in SDLC

### 🎯 Focus Areas

✅ **Building Phase**

- Automate build processes using tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).

✅ **Testing Phase**

- Enable **Continuous Integration (CI)**.
- Automate unit, integration, and regression tests.

✅ **Deployment Phase**

- Implement **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipelines.
- Automate production rollouts with minimal downtime.

---

### ⚡ DevOps Impact

- Improves **efficiency** and **reduces delivery time**.
- Focus on **automation** to eliminate manual intervention.
- Ensures seamless collaboration between developers, QA, and operations teams.

## 🛠 Tools Commonly Used

| Phase                | Tools & Practices           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Version Control**  | Git, GitHub, GitLab         |
| **Build Automation** | Jenkins, Maven, Gradle      |
| **Testing**          | Selenium, JUnit, Cypress    |
| **Deployment**       | Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible |
| **Monitoring**       | Prometheus, Grafana         |

## 📝 Key Takeaways

✅ SDLC is the **backbone of all software delivery processes**.  
✅ DevOps engineers play a **crucial role in automating Build, Test, and Deploy phases**.  
✅ Understanding SDLC is essential for collaboration across teams.  
✅ Automation = Faster delivery + Higher quality.
